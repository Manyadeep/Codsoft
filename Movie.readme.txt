#  Movie Rating Prediction

##  Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict IMDb movie ratings using features like duration, genre, votes, release year, director, and lead actors.

---

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about over 15,000 movies including:

-  `Name` – Movie title  
-  `Year` – Release year (cleaned to numeric)  
- `Duration` – Movie duration in minutes (extracted from text like "109 min")  
- `Genre` – Movie genre  
- `Rating` – IMDb rating (target variable)  
- `Votes` – Number of audience votes (cleaned by removing commas)  
- `Director`, `Actor 1`, `Actor 2`, `Actor 3` – Categorical fields for people involved

---

 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing values
   - Converted `Votes` and `Duration` to numeric
   - Extracted 4-digit year from `Year`

2. **Label Encoding**
   - Encoded `Genre`, `Director`, `Actor 1`, `Actor 2`, `Actor 3` using `LabelEncoder`

3. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardized all features using `StandardScaler`

4. **Model Used**
   - `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score
   - Cross-validation (5-fold)

| MAE                 | 1.05   |
| RMSE                | 1.30   |
| R² Score            | 0.09   |
| Cross-Val R² (mean) | 0.08   |
