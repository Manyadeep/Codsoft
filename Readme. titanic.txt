#  Titanic Survival Prediction

##  Objective
Build a logistic regression model to predict survival of passengers from the Titanic disaster using features like Age, Sex, Pclass, etc.

##  Dataset
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib , seaborn

##  Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning
- Handling Missing Values
- Encoding Categorical Features
- Feature Engineering (FamilySize, IsAlone)
- Train-Test Split with Scaling
- Logistic Regression Model Training
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)

##  Accuracy
Achieved Accuracy: 78%`
